## Cursor Cloud specific instructions

This repository (`DanZai233.github.io`) is a GitHub Pages blog placeholder. As of now it contains only a `README.md` and `LICENSE` file — there is no application code, no build system, no dependencies, and no tests.

### Key facts

- **No services to run.** There are no backend/frontend services, databases, or build steps.
- **No dependencies to install.** There is no `package.json`, `Gemfile`, `requirements.txt`, or any other dependency manifest.
- **No tests.** There are no test suites or lint configurations.
- **No build step.** There is no static site generator configured yet.

### If code is added in the future

Since this is a `*.github.io` repository, it will most likely become a GitHub Pages site. Common setups include:

- **Jekyll** (default for GitHub Pages): look for a `Gemfile` and run `bundle install`, then `bundle exec jekyll serve`.
- **Plain HTML/CSS/JS**: no build step needed; just open `index.html` in a browser.
- **Node-based SSG** (Hugo, Hexo, Next.js, etc.): look for `package.json` and run the appropriate install/dev commands.

Update this file and the VM update script once a framework is chosen.
